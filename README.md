At the end we faced problems with running the project on mobile emulator of Android Studio, we were expect this problem to be solved by the end, but our laptops could not run any project neither on that emulator(virtual mobile device) nor on real mobile device, we are sorry that could not find appropriate laptop on time. We were testing everything in web emulator of Android Studio and the application is working fully, all functionalities are working without errors. We recorded a demo video of that testing.
